# vincentverse

Are you also a fan of [Vincent
Arel-Bundock's](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock) packages? Would you like
to load them easily every time you start a new session? The `vincentverse` is
all you need! Just like the great `tidyverse`, you can now load all of VABâ€™s
packages at once.

This package was created for fun, replicating the structure of the `tidyverse`.
For that reason, it won't be available on CRAN. However, you can easily use it
with the following code:

```r
# install from github
library(remotes)
install_github("JozefRivest/vincentverse")

# load
library(vincentverse)
```

You will have acess to the following packages: 

- [marginaleffects](https://marginaleffects.com)
- [modelsummary](https://modelsummary.com)
- [tinytable](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/tinytable/)
- [countrycode](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/countrycode/index.html)
- [WDI](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/WDI)
- [violets](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/violets)
- [regrets](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/regrets)
- [Rdatasets](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/Rdatasets)
