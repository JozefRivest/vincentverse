# vincentverse

You are also a fan on [Vincent
Arel-Bundock's](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock) packages? You would like
to attached them easily everytime you start a new session? The `vincentverse`
is all you need! Similarly to the great `tidyverse`, you can now have all the
packages from VAB at once! 

The package has been made for fun, so it is not officially avaible through CRAN.
Yet, you can easily use this function with the following code:

```r
devtools::install_github("JozefRivest/vincentverse")
library(vincentverse)
```

You will have acess to the following packages:

- [tinytable](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/tinytable/)
